# SPOTIFY GOLD API Repository
Author: Antonio Navarro | 2ºDAM IES Nervión

## General Information
This repository has the source code of the whole API of Spotify Gold Repository. It uses Flask to handle the requests comings from multiple devices.

## Installation
Because this is a source code and it will be so on, you'll need to have python installed on your desktop. I've used Python 3.9 during development and tests. Once you've clones the repository you have to go to the root directory of the project and execute 'pip install -r requirements.txt' this will install all required pip dependencies for this server to work properly.

To run the server just execute 'python run.py'
